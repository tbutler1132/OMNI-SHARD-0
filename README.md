# ðŸ§  Omnilith

Omnilith is a collaborative, semantic platform for modeling meaning, workflows, and symbolic structure. It's not just software â€” it's a **living system** that evolves as contributors add new types, logic, and interpretations.

> A world where everything is structured, meaningful, and open to redefinition.

## ðŸš€ What It Does

Omnilith lets you:

- Define your own data types (`EntityTypes`, `ConceptTypes`, `ObjectTypes`)
- Build behaviors and protocols using interpretable logic
- Create forms and views that generate dynamic UI from schema
- Let agents (like LLMs) reason about the structure of your world
- Promote and evolve your ontology over time

Everything is editable. Everything is semantic. Everything is self-aware.

## ðŸ§© Core Features

- âœ… Fully semantic type system: `EntityType`, `ObjectType`, `ConceptType`
- âœ… Dynamic schema validation & field derivation
- âœ… Behavior engine with composable steps
- âœ… Agent interface for ontology introspection
- âœ… Modular UI dashboard for contributors
- âœ… Tools for structural promotion and schema mutation

## ðŸ§¬ Why It Matters

Most systems hide their structure. Omnilith **exposes and interprets** it.

- You don't build apps â€” you define living ontologies.
- You don't write code to handle form logic â€” you define semantic forms.
- You don't hardcode workflows â€” you describe protocols.
- You don't simulate meaning â€” you encode it.

## ðŸŒ€ Vision

Omnilith is more than code â€” it's a **recursive, symbolic system** designed to:

- Represent real life
- Enable decentralized collaboration
- Empower users and agents to co-author structure

Itâ€™s an evolving digital language for describing meaning itself.
